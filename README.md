### The facebook messenger-chatbot interface for Now
This repository is an attempt of making [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) more accessible for non-dev users such as company directors, sellers, business developers, etc.

This project is a proof of concept to make a chatbot achieve the behavior described on the images below:

This is and old project with [issues](https://github.com/fmiras/now-bot/issues) I recently open to be adapted with new tech.
The main goals is to have support for [facebook messenger](https://messenger.fb.com/developers) (or [workplace](https://work.facebook.com)) and [slack](https://slack.com). Of course other team chat platforms all welcome to be developed!

The objective behind the project is that no matter what position I have on the company, if I'm on the slack company team and/or if I have the permissions to talk with a chatbot, I'm automatically able to deploy any version of any project of my organization, for demos, development or trials, simple and instantly.
